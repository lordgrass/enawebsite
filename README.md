# Welcome to Onliine!
The best website that simulates the Wii System to the perfection (almost).

## Collaborations
I'm open to collaborations! Come and join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/qMdZZkps2E)
for the project and have a chat with all of us enthusiasts of this project.

## Status
This project is on its early phase of development, meaning that is quite incomplete,
might contain errors, poorly written code and will not focus on performance at the moment.
Thus, it's a great to start and evolve into something bigger, like a Dolphin VM built into
WebAssembly (ðŸ˜³), or a real working Wii Shop Channel to download all sorts of apps.

Visit [this website](https://jerosgamer.me/res/sysver.txt) to check the latest version available.

## Updater
While you tinker with the source code, make sure to often visit the Settings page, which is
in fact an update checker that syncs with my server for new updates and versions to download
from the GitHub repository.

The update method is completely manual, meaning you just have to download the source code
and merge the new files into your previously/outdated downloaded folder.
